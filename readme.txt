A WordPress plugin that customizes excerpts in search results to show text around first search keyword.

== Description ==

Custom Search Excerpt is a WordPress plugin that customizes excerpts in search results by showing text from around the search keywords. This provides users with a more relevant preview, directly highlighting parts of the content related to their search query.

This plugin replaces the standard excerpt shown in search results with a customized version that contains a snippet around the first keyword found. It only modifies the excerpt on search results pages.

To test this plugin in your WordPress site, use the search bar and enter a term that appears in one or more posts. In the search results, the excerpt should now include a snippet containing the searched keyword. By default, the snippet includes 50 characters before and 350 after the keyword.

This plugin focuses on displaying relevant excerpts on search result pages and doesn’t change excerpts elsewhere on your site. It’s lightweight and easy to modify for additional functionality if desired.
